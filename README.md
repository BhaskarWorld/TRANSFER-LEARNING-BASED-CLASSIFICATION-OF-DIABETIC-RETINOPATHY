# TRANSFER-LEARNING-BASED-CLASSIFICATION-OF-DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY
Diabetic Retinopathy is caused due to damaging the blood vessels located at the back of the eye (retina). Symptoms such as blurriness, dark spots, blindness, etc. can be seen due to diabetic retinopathy. In this paper, we perform the analysis of diabetic retinopathy detection using three pre-trained networks â€“ VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 on Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. The dataset consists of five classes of images and is disproportionately balanced. So, we augmented new images, perform preprocessing, use different evaluation metrics and finally compared the results of these three pre-trained networks. Out of these three models, VGG16 achieves the highest accuracy of 78% and Kappa score of 0.721. We also observe that out of the five classes of images present in the dataset, class 2 has the lowest precision, recall as well as F1-score values.
